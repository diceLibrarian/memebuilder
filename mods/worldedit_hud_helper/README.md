## Chat commands
worldedit_hud_helper provides 2 chat commands:

## `//hud`
Toggles whether the HUD is shown or not.


## `//hudoffset <offset_in_pixels>`
Adjusts the vertical height of the HUD. For example, to adjust it to be greater (higher up on the screen), do this:

```
//hudoffset 50
```

The default value is 0. You can reset to the default value like this:

```

```
